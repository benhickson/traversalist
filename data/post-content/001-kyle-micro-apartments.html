<p>The current solution to fixing New York City’s housing affordability problem is very tiny apartments. These micro-units are typically around 300 sq ft, with some as small as 150 sq ft. That’s really small. The average NYC studio is about 550 sq ft, and that’s already too small by most standards. Architects design these units with multi-purpose furniture to maximize space. Beds that fold into the wall allow the living room to double as a bedroom. A telescoping table can expand from a simple desk to a table for four. Every piece of furniture has storage built into it. Because everything needs to have multiple functions, most microunits come furnished. The poster child of micro-apartments in NYC is Carmel Place in the Kips Bay neighborhood of Manhattan. Carmel Place is the result of an initiative to address the housing problems in NYC. The plan was to find a way to cram more apartments, and therefore people, together without increasing the overall footprint of a building. Theoretically, with more units the price of each unit would decrease, solving both the housing shortage and affordability problems that NYC currently faces.</p>

<p>The success of this project is debatable. Part of the reason is micro-units don’t adequately address housing problems holistically. First off, they appeal only to a specific demographic — young, single professionals. The stifling size of these apartments cannot accommodate larger households (even a couple would constantly trip over each other). So eventually, most occupants would grow out these apartments. But in a city like NY where 33% of the population is single, micro-units do make sense. Until you realize these young, single professionals would also need a lot of disposable income as they would spend most of their free time eating out and socializing in public spaces. If you’re a home-body, these aren’t for you. There just isn’t enough space in a micro apartment to cook meals, entertain, or even spend extended time in them.</p>

<p>The most glaring problem with micro-apartments is that despite being smaller than the average studio, they are more expensive. The units in Carmel Place go for $2400. A quick search on StreetEasy in the Kips Bay neighborhood shows many studio and 1-bed apartments twice the size of the units at Carmel Place for around the same price or even cheaper. If micro-apartments are built on a wide-spread scale, they’ll increase the price per square footage resulting in apartments that are smaller on average and still unaffordable. Tenants will be paying the same price for less space.</p>

<p>Carmel Place had to get mayoral permission to be exempt from a city law that mandates a unit having a minimum of 400 sq ft. The reason that law was put into place was because living in a small space can have negative impacts on mental health. When your entire apartment is one room, that room becomes your bedroom, living room, and kitchen all at once, and therefore the apartment becomes nothing at all. There’s an adage that advises against working in bed because it impacts productivity. A bed is for sleeping and relaxing, not working. A kitchen is for cooking and nourishment, not storing clothes. At Carmel Place, there is no separation of activity creating confusion in the brain which functions primarily by compartmentalizing. The cramped living conditions at Carmel Place cause stress and anxiety. Uncluttered surfaces evoke a sense of calm, but smaller apartment are easily cluttered. As cities grow in population and density, living spaces will shrink, but there is a point at which residents are impacted negatively.</p>

<p>The only seeable solution to NYC’s housing crisis is through legislative policy. Carmel Place is an example of the failings of micro-apartments. Rents will continue to rise without regulation and policy changes, even if thousands of units were built. Regulated micro-units could work to relieve the financial burden of renting in the city. And if financial burdens were lifted, the mental stresses of living in a small space might be forgivable. Not mention with less of one’s income dedicated to rent, there’s disposable income to get out of the apartment. NYC’s housing problems are complex, and it’ll take a combination of solutions to fix them. However, the mental health of New Yorkers should always be prioritized.</p>
