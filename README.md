# the-blog

Welcome! `:kami_emoji:`

This is where we'll keep the codebase for the blog, and potentially the content too (might need to exlude images and store those elsewhere, we'll see). The content will be backed up in Google Docs - you can keep images inline in those documenents and GDocs stores them at full-resolution, and easy to extract.

## Issues

I like to to use the Issues tab here to keep track of **ideas for new features** (and of course to track issues/bugs). Any ideas you have, please feel free to add as an issue, and we can discuss in the comment thread there. Alternatively, you can def just drop your ideas in Discord, and I'll create the Issue myself. Do what you like! `Feel f r e e.`



## Setup Notes

Here's where I'll keep track of setup notes, to make re-creating this server a breeze, should we ever want or need to.
